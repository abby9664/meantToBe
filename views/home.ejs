      Every month we update this site with a group of people volunteering to
      video chat with you. We try to invite volunteers with diverse backgrounds
      so you can relate better.
      <br />
      If you didn’t match with a mentor immediately, don’t feel discouraged. We
      encourage you to send out connections each month.
