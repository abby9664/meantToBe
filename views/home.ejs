      <h3>Chat</h3>
      <p>
        Ideally, one of the mentors you’ve sent a request to accepts your

    <h2>How does meantToBe work?</h2>
    <p>
      Every month we update this site with a group of people volunteering to
      video chat with you. We try to invite volunteers with diverse backgrounds
      so you can relate better.
      <br />
      If you didn’t match with a mentor immediately, don’t feel discouraged. We
      encourage you to send out connections each month.
